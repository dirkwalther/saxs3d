Synopsis: A reconstruction algorithm is described
to yield three-dimensional models from one-dimensional SAXS data
of biomolecules in solution.

Available Programs:

saxs3d  - model reconstruction from SAXS scattering profile data
xlattice  - display and superpositions of bead models and structures
pdb2xyz_saxs  - calculation of Debye scattering profiles from proteins
in pdb format and conversion into xyz-format to be used in xlattice

Saxs3D - 3D-reconstruction program from scattering profile data

Compile with: cc saxs3d.c -lm -o saxs3d, or cc saxs3d.c -lm -O3 -o saxs3d (with optimization)

usage: command <saxs_profile_file> -l <lattice spacing> -i <initial xyz-file> -rm_mod <mod>
        -out <id_string> -flood -steepest -q -max_s <s_max> -xyz <target xyz-file>
        -rw <weight> -tw <weight> -g <npoints> -rg <estimated Rg>

         -l      lattice spacing in Angstrom
         -i      start from a given xyz-structure
         -rm_mod        removal-attempt every cycle%mod==0, default:mod=1
         -out  write output to files containing id_string, default: id_string=test
                  models are continueously written to lattice_id_string.xyz
                  profiles are continueously written to saxsProfile_id_string.dat
                  profile fit-scores are continueously written to scores_id_string.dat

         -flood      keep adding beads until no improvement can be made, then remove
         -steepest  find the steepest descent move (i.e. exhaustive search, slow!)
         -q             input saxsfile is in q-scale (q=2Pi s)
         -max_s     chop off profile beyond s_max
         -xyz          fill a lattice to match a target xyz-structure (no minimization)
         -rw           weight on correlation componenet of scoring function, default weight=10.0
         -tw           weight on deviations in the tail of the profile, default weight=3.0
         -g             <npoints> points to consider in Guinier fit, default: npoints=7
         -rg            <Rg> slope of Guinier fit according to estimated Rg
         -v             verbose output to the screen

Example:  saxs3d saxs_2bb2.dat -l 12 -v -out 2bb2
                 input file saxs_2bb2.dat contained in directory examples/
                 xyz-models are written to lattice_2bb2.xyz
                 profiles are written to saxsProfile_2bb2.dat
                 scores are written to scores_2bb2.dat
NOTE: input profile has to start with the first truly measured intensity, i.e. the beam stop has to be removed.
 
 
XLATTICE - Visualization of lattice models and macromolecular structures
(Xwindow program, runs on all UNIX platforms running X)

Compile with: cc Xlattice.c -lm -lX11 -o xlattice

Usage:

Xlattice v990315, Author: Dr Dirk Walther (UCSF)
 

usage: command model1.xyz [model2.xyz]

        maximally two structures at a time, extension '.xyz' required

        Format of xyz-file:

                %i (number_of_beads)
                %f %f (bead_radius  considered_as_bonded_cutoff_length)
                %s %f %f %f (label x-coord y-coord z-coord)
                .
                .
                .

Options
        -rms   calculate overlap (in percent) only, no display
        -grid   <GridSpacing>
                    display ruler with ticks separated at GridSpacing Angstroms
        -nosup  no superposition upon invokation of program
                    if structures are too big, superposition may take a long time.
        -f      <min number of bonds>
                    apply filter by requiring that a bead
                    has at least <min number of bonds> within <considered_as_bonded_cutoff_length>,
                    purpose: filtering of superimposed models (contrast enhancement)
        -label  show labels

Example: xlattice lattice_2bb2.xyz 2bb2_ca.xyz
 

        Mouse actions:

                left: rotate
                middle: translate
                shift+above: apply to only one model if two are loaded
                right: zoom

                left+middle: adjust drawing slab width
                right+middle: shift drawing slab in z-direction

        invisible corner-buttons:

                upper left corner: exit
                lower left corner:
                        left mouse button: calculate overlap in percent
                        right mouse button: superimpose models
                lower right corner: write current model to file named xlattice_supimp.xyz


 
 
 

pdb2xyz_saxs - calculate Debye scattering profiles and convert pdb-structures into
xyz-format



 

Compile with: cc pdb2xyz_saxs.c -lm -o pdb2xyz_saxs

pdb2xyz_saxs (D.Walther 1999)

usage: command <pdb_file>  C  -out <out_name>  [-het]  [-ca]

        C = chainID, '_'-take all chains, 'A'-take chain A only
               chainID has to be specified, even if it is a single chain protein (then '_')
        -out  out_name = write output to files containing <out_name> as name, default is test
        -het  (optional) - include hetero atoms in both saxs profile and xyz-output
        -ca    (optional) - write CAlpha atoms only to xyz-file

NOTE: first argument has to be the protein file, second arg the chain identifier !

Example: pdb2xyz_saxs pdb1mbo.ent _ -out test -het
                 creates: test.xyz and saxs_test.dat
                 view with xlattice test.xyz
